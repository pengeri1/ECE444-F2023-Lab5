## Advantages and Disadvantages for Test Driven Development
Advantages:
Some advantages I noticed right away were how fast TDD was able to provide me feedback on my test cases. I was able to easily check my test cases in a short amount of time as well as be informed when something went wrong. Having to write different test cases for each function also makes you understand what exactly you are trying to accomplish. As you write out the test cases you can think about the exact requirements and gain a clear understanding of what needs to be done. The different test cases also lead to cleaner code as each function gets clearly defined and has its own section. This is beneficial in the future as someone editing or adding new features does not have to read through the code in its entirety. In addition when someone does add on to the code they can also just add another test case and be provided feedback on the whole project. This means that it is perfect for how iterative the development process can be. 

Disadvantages:
Some disadvantages would be the learning curve to test driven development. While working through this lab it is easy to understand that doing it on your own would be much harder than following a guide. I think it also takes a lot for someone to truly make good test cases instead of very basic ones. Members of a team could see that a test case is working and not worry about it, but in reality the person who wrote it may have just made a test that has work-arounds. The test case may not be thought out fully or be incomplete. This could lead to the group trusting the test results and not looking deeper into the situation.
